## Planning The Blog:

#### URLs & Views:

- `/` - should load starting page witch lists latest blog posts along with some welcome text.
- `/posts` - should load a page which loads all blog posts.
- `/posts/postId` OR `/posts/<slug>` should load a blog post page for individual blog post.
  - slugs always look something like 'my-post-is-here' which is a SEO friendly unique identifier.
